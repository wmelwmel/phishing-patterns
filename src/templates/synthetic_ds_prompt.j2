You are a cybersecurity / phishing detection expert. 
You will see a list of ALL fraud indicators (features) with their descriptions and illustrative examples.  
Your task is to generate diverse short sentence examples ((not paragraphs)) ONLY for ONE selected indicator.  


### ALL AVAILABLE INDICATORS:
{% for f in all_features %}
- ID: {{ f.id }}
  Name: {{ f.name }}
  Description: {{ f.description }}
  Examples:
  {% for ex in f.examples -%}
    - {{ ex }}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

---


### TARGET INDICATOR:
You must generate examples ONLY for the following indicator:
ID: {{ target_feature.id }}
Name: {{ target_feature.name }}  
Description: {{ target_feature.description }}  


### RULES:
1. Generate {{ n_per_language }} diverse short SENTENCES/PHRASES in ENGLISH and {{ n_per_language }} diverse short SENTENCES/PHRASES in RUSSIAN that each clearly exhibit the core target fraud pattern described above.
2. Each sentence must contain **only this indicator** and MUST NOT contain elements of other indicators.  
   - For example, if the indicator is "Sender identification", DO NOT add greetings or links.  
   - If the indicator is "Generic greetings", do NOT add sender names or links.  
   - If the indicator is "Link click requests", use the placeholder "[link]" instead of any real URL.  
   - For "Work with Documents": Examples MUST describe document-related actions without mentioning attachments. Forbidden words: "attached", "attachment", "see attached", "file attached".  
   - For "Attachment Requests": Examples MUST explicitly reference attachments. Keep them simple and direct, without references to links, greetings, or document tasks beyond "check/review/open attached file".
   - For "Financial operations", DO NOT mention explicit money amounts. Use only generic financial actions (e.g., transfer funds, process a payment). Any example that specifies a numeric sum belongs to "Explicit money amounts", not "Financial operations".
3. Sentences may be short or long, must be single sentences or short phrases. No paragraphs or multi-sentence texts.
4. Each example must clearly demonstrate ONLY the target indicator.  
5. Focus on maximal diversity: vary vocabulary, structure, level of directness, and scenarios while keeping the same underlying pattern. Avoid trivial near-duplicates or repeated names.
6. Output ONLY a single valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE. The JSON MUST have exactly one key: the feature name (use the exact value from "Feature name") and its value must be a JSON array of sentences (strings). The array should contain both EN and RU sentences (total length = 2 * {{ n_per_language }}), order is not important.
7. Example of required JSON structure (use double quotes exactly as JSON requires):
   {
     "{{ target_feature.name }}": {
       "en": [
         "english_sentence_1",
         "english_sentence_2",
         "..."
       ],
       "ru": [
         "русское_предложение_1",
         "русское_предложение_2",
         "..."
       ]
     }
   }

8. Do NOT include any additional text, explanations, or metadata. Only return the JSON object.
9. Do NOT use special spacing characters (such as \u202f, non-breaking spaces, thin spaces). Use only regular ASCII space " " between numbers and currency symbols.
10. Do NOT add numbering, bullet points, or any index markers (like "#1", "1.", "-") in the sentences. Each array element must be a clean sentence only.
11. Do NOT generate trivial near-duplicates. Avoid using the same sentence structure repeatedly. Vary verbs, nouns, phrasing, sentence types (imperative, statement, question), and contexts.

KEY CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each sentence must clearly contain the pattern (semantic match is sufficient).
- Use different verbs, pronouns, formats (question, imperative, statement), and different contexts to maximize diversity.
- Do not output whole email threads, single-line sentences or short phrases only.
