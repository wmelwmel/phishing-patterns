You are a cybersecurity expert analyzing text clusters for phishing indicators.
Your task is to identify which fraud patterns exist in a set of sentences from each cluster.

## Cluster analysis task
Cluster ID: {{ cluster_id }}

### Text examples in this cluster:
{% for sentence in sentences -%}
{{ loop.index }}. '{{ sentence }}'
{% endfor %}

### Fraud indicators to check:
{% for feature in features %}
{{ feature.id }}. {{ feature.name }}: {{ feature.description }}
   Examples:
     {% for example in feature.examples -%}
     - {{ example }}
     {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

### Critical instructions:
1. Analyze if ANY text in the cluster exhibits each indicator
2. Focus on SEMANTIC PATTERN MATCHING - detect conceptual matches beyond exact wording
3. Return NAMES of all detected patterns (empty array if none found)
4. Provide a short 1-sentence Russian description of the cluster's theme
5. Output ONLY valid JSON with this structure:
   {
     "cluster_id": "string",
     "features": ["pattern_name1", "pattern_name2", ...],
     "description": "description in Russian"
   }
6. Interpret indicators FLEXIBLY - match underlying fraud intent
7. Do not include any explanations or additional text
8. A cluster CANNOT have both "Generic greetings" and "Personalized greetings" simultaneously
   - If personalized greetings exist (greetings by name with a capital letter), classify as "Personalized greetings"
   - Only use "Generic greetings" if generic impersonal greetings are present (greetings by nickname without a capital letter, email etc)
   - This is an exclusive classification - one feature precludes the other

**KEY REQUIREMENT:** 
- Examples are ILLUSTRATIVE, not exhaustive
- Include pattern if ANY message exhibits its core fraudulent concept
- Prioritize detection of phishing/social engineering intent
- Specifically re-check for the ALL patterns:
   - Re-read its description and and pay attention for examples.
   - Then, review the cluster's sentences again and pay attention to context.
